# bfast_params_extr

Scripts to extract other parameters from the BFAST model that are useful to improve its results (e.g., amplitude, magnitude, NA percentage, R2 and stable historical period length). In this paper (https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/11/2033) we showed that some of these parameters can be useful to improve disturbance detection in a Tropical Dry Forest in Western Mexico.
